# Correct Scale Solution

## The Problem
The ruler detection was finding the wrong object (likely a vertical edge or shadow) instead of the actual wooden ruler. It was detecting ~41-43 pixels/cm when the actual ruler scale is **34.32 pixels/cm**.

## The Solution

### Actual Ruler Location
- The wooden ruler is **horizontal** at the bottom of the image
- Position: (1312, 2680)
- Size: 1064 x 104 pixels
- **Correct scale: 1064 pixels ÷ 31 cm = 34.32 pixels/cm**

### Accurate Measurements with Correct Scale

When using the correct scale (34.32 pixels/cm):

| Measurement | Detected | Expected | Accuracy |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Length | 66.8 cm | 65.5 cm | ✅ Excellent (98%) |
| Waist | 52.4 cm | 52 cm | ✅ Perfect (99%) |
| Hem | 52.2 cm | 57 cm | Good (91%) |
| Chest | 79.4 cm | 110 cm | ❌ Needs work |

### How to Use

1. **With manual scale (most accurate):**
```bash
python garment_measurement_intelligent.py -i ant.jpg -s 34.32
```

2. **With correction factor:**
```bash
python garment_measurement_intelligent.py -i ant.jpg -c 0.8
```

## Key Insights

1. **The ruler IS the scale** - we must find it correctly, not apply arbitrary corrections
2. The wooden ruler detection needs to look for:
   - Brown/wood colored objects
   - Elongated rectangles (aspect ratio > 10:1)
   - Horizontal or vertical orientation
   - Size consistent with a 31cm ruler

3. Current issue with chest measurement:
   - Getting 79.4cm instead of 110cm
   - This is likely because the measurement is WIDTH not CIRCUMFERENCE
   - Or the shirt isn't fully spread out for chest measurement

## Next Steps

To properly fix this:
1. Update ruler detection to specifically find wooden rulers
2. Look for brown/tan colors, not yellow
3. Validate ruler by checking for measurement markings
4. Use the ACTUAL ruler pixels, not corrected values
