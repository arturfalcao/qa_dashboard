## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm (for local development)

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start services (database, minio, api)
docker compose up postgres minio minio-setup api -d

# Run frontend in development mode  
cd apps/web && pnpm dev

# Seed database
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/admin/seed

# Start mock generator
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/mock/inspections/start
```

## üîÑ Transitioning to Production

The codebase is designed for easy transition from mock data to real operator inputs:

1. **Replace mock endpoints**: Remove `/mock/*` routes
2. **Add operator interface**: Build mobile-friendly inspection forms  
3. **Real image upload**: Implement camera capture and upload to MinIO
4. **Webhook integration**: Add real-time notifications (Slack, email)
5. **Enhanced auth**: Integrate with enterprise SSO
6. **Scaling**: Add Redis for caching, load balancers, etc.

All core APIs (`/inspections`, `/batches`, `/analytics`, `/exports`) remain unchanged.

## üìà Performance & Scalability

- **Database**: Optimized indexes for tenant-scoped queries
- **Caching**: TanStack Query with intelligent cache invalidation  
- **Images**: MinIO with presigned URLs (reduces server load)
- **Polling**: Efficient since-based incremental updates
- **Bundle size**: Optimized with Next.js 14 and proper code splitting

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Services won't start**:
```bash
docker compose down -v  # Remove volumes
docker compose up --build
```

**Database connection errors**:
- Wait for PostgreSQL health check to pass
- Check logs: `docker compose logs postgres`

**Image loading issues**:  
- Verify MinIO is running: http://localhost:9001
- Check bucket permissions (should be public)

**Frontend build errors**:
```bash
cd apps/web && rm -rf .next node_modules && pnpm install
```

### Logs & Monitoring
```bash
# View all service logs
docker compose logs -f

# API logs only  
docker compose logs -f api

# Database logs
docker compose logs postgres
```

## üîÆ Next Steps

For production deployment:

1. **Environment Variables**: Configure for production
2. **SSL/TLS**: Add HTTPS certificates  
3. **Monitoring**: Add application monitoring (DataDog, New Relic)
4. **Backup**: Implement database backup strategy
5. **CDN**: Add CloudFront/CloudFlare for static assets
6. **Secrets**: Use proper secret management (AWS Secrets Manager)
